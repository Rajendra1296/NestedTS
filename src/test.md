# test
in TS most of the testing is done by jest
in order to make jest understand the test file we should make sure that the test file ends with ./spec.ts 
# to test we 
have test in package.json already 
hence we execute the command 
# yarn test
> in order to make it run every time when we make changes in a spec file we use different command that is # yarn test --watch 
which will make the test run every time there is a change in spec file
